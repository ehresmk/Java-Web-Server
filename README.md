# Java-Web-Server
Utilizes local ports to host a web server in Java, see README for instructions.

Hosts a webserver on local ports 8888 and 5555.
-When you run the program open a browser and type "localhost:8888/index.html" to access the webserver with that html file.
  (you can also do "localhost:8888/liwide.html" to access that seperate file)
-Port 5555 is used to demonstrate redirection using a webserver and it will automatically redirect the user to google.com
when you do "localhost:5555/(any of the files)"
